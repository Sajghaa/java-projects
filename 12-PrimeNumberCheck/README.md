# Prime Number Checker (Using Loop in Java)

## Description
This Java program checks whether a given integer is a **prime number** or not.  
It reads the number from the user and uses an iterative loop to determine if the number has any divisors other than 1 and itself.  

---

## Features
- Accepts integer input from the user
- Checks edge cases (`n <= 1`)
- Uses a **loop up to √n** for efficiency
- Uses a boolean flag for clear logic
- Prints whether the number is prime or not
- Properly closes the `Scanner` object

---

## How to Use
1. Compile the program:
```bash
javac PrimeCheck.java
